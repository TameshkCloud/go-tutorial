# Defer
A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("world")

	fmt.Println("hello")
}
```

## Stacking defers
Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("counting")

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		defer fmt.Println(i)
	}

	fmt.Println("done")
}
```
